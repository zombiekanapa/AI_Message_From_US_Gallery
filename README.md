# AI_Message_from_US_Gallery

A curated collection of speculative, symbolic, interstellar-message-style artworks generated by Stable Diffusion 1.03.  
Each image represents a fragment of a hypothetical transmission from humanity to an unknown intelligence — blending cryptic symbols, alien glyphs, cosmic cartography, and hybrid organic-mechanical forms.

## Contents
- **/gallery/** — Original image set
- **/notes/** — Visual motif notes, recurring patterns, and symbolic references
- **/prompts/** — JSON system prompts for external AI platforms (e.g., Skywork.AI)
- **/missing_pages/** — AI-generated textual descriptions for “missing” pages in the codex

## Purpose
This repository serves as both an **archive** and a **launchpad** for creative AI experiments:
- Preserve the original gallery for reference
- Provide structured prompts for generating new, stylistically consistent “pages”
- Encourage collaborative interpretation and expansion

## How to Use
1. Browse `/gallery/` to understand the visual language.
2. Review `/notes/gallery_notes.txt` for recurring motifs.
3. Use `/prompts/skywork_missing_pages.json` with your chosen AI platform.
4. Contribute your own “missing pages” via pull requests.
